    question: 'What is SAST?',
    answer:
      "SAST â€” the Society for Aerospace and Space Technology â€” is where imagination meets innovation. ðŸš€It sounds like a sci-fi crew from a space movie (and honestly, it is), but itâ€™s one of the most active and creative tech clubs on campus. From building satellites to launching open-source Challenge like Project Nebula, SAST is your launchpad if youâ€™re curious about space, code, and collaborative chaos that somehow always leads to brilliance",
  },
